# EasyDNS
## What is EasyDNS?
EasyDNS is an application designed to make switching of your DNS Servers easier and less intrusive.
No requirements for Elevated Privileges when switching your DNS, and no need to manually flush your DNS either.

### The Good Features
 - Detects network device changes (*such as WiFi enabled/disabled*).
 - Simple User Interface.
 - Completely free, including no adverts. (***YAY***)
 - No Elevated Privileges required to quickly switch DNS servers.
### The Bad Features
 - Requires installing a Window's Service.
 - Still not idiot or bug proof.
 - Some Anti Virus applications cause errors
-- Requires adding the files/folder to the exclusions.

## User Interface
![Current DNS Setting matching the select DNS Setting](https://images2.imgbox.com/d4/c9/tOlw7FJb_o.png)

> Because the **New DNS** and the **Current DNS** are the same, there is nothing
> to do.


![Current DNS Setting not matching the selected DNS Setting](https://images2.imgbox.com/84/8f/YnLzODQu_o.png)

> The Play symbol on the right hand side indicates that the DNS can be
> changed.
